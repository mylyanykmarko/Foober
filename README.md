# What our project about?

_Today a lot of people due to some reasons couldn't go to grosery due certain reasons. Somebody haven't time for that, another hates shopping, others have physical constraints, which don't allow thew to go outside. Our project is about creating phone app which will help people to go shopping without even going outside theirs' houses._


# How it works?

* _Create account in our app_
* _Choose your role: courier or purchaser_
* _If you are purchaser you just type which products you want and wait_
* _If you are courier you in the begining you choose purchasers, product whose products you can buy. Then you buy and deliver these products to buyers_ 
* In the ending purchasers pay off money including some extra money for delivery
